# project_graphs
Project created for classes "Graphs and their uses" by team of 4 students.

The code is not a consistent program. 
Every file is written in Python 3.0 language.

The best way to check the code is to open it with a proper IDE e.g. PyCharm.

The other way is to open a terminal (for Linux) and open it by commands:

chmod +x file.py
./file.py

Some of files can not to work properly. 
In this situation they are a part of another program file and there their work can be checked.
